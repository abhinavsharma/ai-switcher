# Privacy Policy for AI Switcher

## Overview
AI Switcher is a Chrome extension designed to help users transfer conversations between different AI chat platforms. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of any data handled by our extension.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect any user data.** AI Switcher:
- Does not track your browsing activity
- Does not store your conversations
- Does not send any data to external servers
- Does not use analytics or tracking tools

## How the Extension Works
AI Switcher operates entirely within your browser. When you use the extension:
1. It identifies when you are on a supported AI chat platform
2. It provides functionality to copy conversation content to your clipboard
3. All processing happens locally on your device

These permissions are used solely for the purpose of transferring conversations between AI platforms and never for data collection.

## Changes to This Policy
Any updates to this privacy policy will be posted within the extension's description in the Chrome Web Store.
